Dry Lab codes for <b>CEApture</b> üìé

CEApture, short for 'capturing CEA protein', is the project for 2023 iGEM competition performed by KUAS-Korea University Association of Synthetic biology. <br/>
As a member of the KUAS Dry Lab, I actively participated in computational modeling work during the design of CEApture. Below is the workflow of the main activities performed in the dry lab. AI models and programming tools used are indicated in bold.
