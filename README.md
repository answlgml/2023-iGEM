# 2023-iGEM
Dry Lab codes for <b>CEApture</b> üìé

CEApture is a user-friendly cervical cancer testing kit with a particular focus on facilitating early diagnosis, and the project for 2023 iGEM competition performed by KUAS-Korea University Association of Synthetic biology. <br/>
As a member of the KUAS Dry Lab, I participated in AI modeling & programming work during the design of CEApture. Below is the workflow of the main activities performed in the dry lab. <br/>

First, we conceived the idea of using nucleic acid for CEA‚Äôs biomarker through the use of <b>iDRPro-SC</b>. With the outcome, <b>HDock</b>‚Äôs computation showed that N56 DNA aptamer would make the highest performance in binding with CEA. To validate N56, we derived <b>a mathematical model</b> for predicting binding affinity between DNA aptamer N56 and CEA. Further, we predicted CEA‚Äôs binding site with N56 using <b>DP-bind</b> and <b>FTMove</b>. After cross-validation, we compared the binding site candidate with a real 3D image of the CEA-N56 complex generated in the wet lab. Finally, by discussing its vertical binding interaction, we confirmed the reliable binding probability between N56 and CEA through the entire modeling process. <br/>
